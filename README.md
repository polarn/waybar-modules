# waybar-modules
Just some personal Waybar modules written in GO. Just to learn some GO.

Currently you can use `make` to build, the binary will be in the `build` folder.

## waybar-gitlab-mr
A Waybar "module" to display number of merge requests the user has to review

It needs a Gitlab personal access token with api read only access. It needs to be set using the `GITLAB_TOKEN` environment variable.

You can control how often it will poll the Gitlab API, by default it will poll every `60` seconds. Use the CLI option `-interval X` to change.

The command will output JSON that Waybar can use to update a module. The fields outputted are:

* text - the number of merge requests found, 0 or more.
* tooltip - outputs merge request titles separated with linefeed.
* class - For usage in `style.css`, outputs `none` or `found` depending on if there is a merge request or not.
* alt - use this to pick an icon using `format-icons`

Add this to your Waybar configuration file, usually `~/.config/waybar/config`:

```json
    "custom/gitlab": {
        "format": "{} {icon}",
        "return-type": "json",
        "format-icons": {
            "found": "",
            "none": ""
        },
        "exec-if": "which waybar-gitlab-mr",
        "exec": "GITLAB_TOKEN=<token-with-read-api> waybar-gitlab-mr"
    }
```

Here is an example of how to style it using the `~/.config/waybar/style.css` file, remember that `class` outputted in the JSON from the command will have `none` or `found` set so you can use that here. You can also just skip the class part of the style, and just have one block.

```css
#custom-gitlab.none {
    margin-top: 6px;
    margin-left: 8px;
    padding-left: 10px;
    margin-bottom: 0px;
    padding-right: 10px;
    border-radius: 10px;
    transition: none;
    color: #514112;
    background: #d4ab30;
}

#custom-gitlab.found {
    margin-top: 6px;
    margin-left: 8px;
    padding-left: 10px;
    margin-bottom: 0px;
    padding-right: 10px;
    border-radius: 10px;
    transition: none;
    color: #78611a;
    background: #fecf48;
}
```
